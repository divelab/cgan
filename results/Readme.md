##Update   We released more experimental results. Please check the newly uploaded images. Each images contains 5 examples of a same protein class.




We add more results for a better judgement for the readers. We release the results for 50 different testing examples. All shown images are selected randomly and they have been colored and cropped for visualization purpose.

Each row corresponds to the results of one testing example. 

The first column is the input image showing the membrane and the nucleus. The second column shows the groundtruth of the protein we try to predict. The following ones are generated structures using different approaches in the following order: cGANs with copy connection, cGANs with self-gated connection, cGANs with encoder-gated connection, cGANs with label-gated connection, and the existing AAE-based approach.
